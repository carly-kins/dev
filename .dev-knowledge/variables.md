# Variable Declarations and Assignments

## Python 	
```my_int = 5
my_str = "Hello world!"
``` 	
Python prefers snake_case for variable style.

## Java 	
```int myVar = 5;
string myStr = "Hello world!";
``` 	
The first item in the variable declaration line (int, string, etc.) is the data type. The variable cannot change types once declared to be a certain type. Java prefers camelCase for variable names.

## C, C++, C# 	
```int myVar = 5;
string myStr = "Hello world!"; 
```	
The first item in the variable declaration line (int, string, etc.) is the data type. The variable cannot change types once declared to be a certain type. C prefers camelCase for variable names.

## JavaScript 	
```var myVar = 5;
var myStr = "Hello world!";
``` 	
var is used whenever creating a new variable, but it does not represent a type. JavaScript prefers camelCase for variable names.

## VB.NET 	
```Dim MyVar As Integer = 5
Dim MyStr As String = "Hello world!" 
```	
types (As Integer, As String) are optional but recommended in VB.NET. VB.NET prefers camelCase for variable names, but often capitalizes the first letter, too (e.g. MyVar instead of myVar).

## Matlab 	
```my_var = 5
my_str = "Hello world!" 
```	
Matlab has few consistent variable name styles.

## Swift 	
```var myVar = 5
var myStr = "Hello world!"
``` 	
Swift prefers camelCase for variable names.

## Ruby 	
```my_var = 5
my_str = "Hello world!" 
```
Ruby prefers snake_case for variable names.
